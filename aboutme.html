    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img class="image" src = "artunphoto.png">
    <p>Hi, I'm Artun. For the first twelve years of my life I lived in Virginia but in 7th Grade I moved to Piedmont, California. I love doing math and never get bored of it and I race bikes whether that be mountain biking or road biking. My favorite color is blue and I like food. I am currently a Junior at Piedmont High School and am taking AP Computer Science Principles.</p>
