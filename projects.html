    <p class="a">This is a solar oven I designed and built for my physics class. We were challenged to research a specific country and, using materials that are found in that country, construct a solar oven to help the poeple of that country get by easier. The oven reached a maximum temperature of 100 degrees fahrenheit which is much more than anticipated and completion took several days of planning on cad software, building itself, and numerous trials of testing.

<p class="a">Another project I did was build a windmill. This again was for physics and we used the same tactic of researching a country that goes along with the windmill to help that country out with the windmill. For the windmill, we resaerched blade designs and basically everything about a windmill including gear ratio and how the generator really works. Multiple trials were done to test the best material shape and number of blades for the windmill.</p>
